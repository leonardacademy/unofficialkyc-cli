## FAQ

# What is UnofficialKYC?

UnofficialKYC is a platform for users to link their accounts on many online
services to a single anonymous charitable donation, while maintaining seperate
identities between those services. In doing this, UFKYC provides a way for
companies to penalize the creation of many different accounts, without
requiring genuinely new users to pay money they haven't already provided
before, and without having to require identifying information from new users
like passports or IDs. It also provides a way for those services to support
single sign-on without learning user identities, or being able to tie activity
between UFKYC accounts.

By incorporating UnofficialKYC into their authentication or signup flow, websites can:

1. Prevent the vast majority of phishing attacks, for users that stick to
   UFKYC's unique authentication workflow, even for services where the user is
   unsure of the domain name they're supposed to authenticate to.
2. Prohibitively increase the difficulty of launching successful large-scale spam or DDoS attacks against your service.
3. Provide a second factor of authentication that is both automatically backed
   up and does not require per-site configuration by users.
4. Greatly cut down on duplicate account creation, and provide a financial
   hurdle for banned or punished users' re-registeration, without having to
   implemment a (local and unique) paywall to use your service.
5. Help reduce extreme global poverty.
